# Hardhat Hackathon Boilerplate

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate
npm install

````

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
````

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## Troubleshooting

## use multiple compiler versions

```sh
module.exports = {
    solidity: {
              compilers: [
              {
  version: "0.5.5",},
              {
            version: "0.6.7",
            settings: {},
              },
              ],

};
